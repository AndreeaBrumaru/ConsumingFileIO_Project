Java Homework

1) Spring Boot App:
- using at least Java 8 (use java streams)
- build an REST API (JSON format) :
- GET
- POST
- DELETE
- read/write/delete data from DB (either in memory or standalone) (SQL/NoSQL)
- write tests using embedded db

How it works:
- make calls using Postman to show working functionality

Description:
Build a Spring Boot Application that can read/write/delete data from a DB. We can simmulate a library (loan books to people).
We can add new books to our inventory, modify data about existing books, remove books that we don't use anymore.
We would also like to keep track of which book was given to whick person, and if a person has returned the book, we need to make it available again.


Expectations:
- follow Spring guidelines for builing a sevice: separate in layers (controller, service, repo)
- using Java 8 functionality properly
- clean code / simple code
- endpoint input validation
- db modelling knowledge
- unit tests, meaningfull tests




2) Electric scooter rental APP

Description:
Build a Spring Boot Application that can read/write/delete data form a DB. We can simmulate an electric scooter rental application.
We need to be able to add/update/delete(soft delete) scooters, check rentals, get reports on how the scooters were used in a certain period.
People need to be able to rent scooters and the app will need to calculate the price of the ride based on how the scooter was used.
The user can also check hes ride history.
